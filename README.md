## Overview
This repository contains the replication materials for the paper:  

**Martijn Schoonvelde, Gijs Schumacher, Bert N. Bakker**  
*"Friends With Text as Data Benefits: Assessing and Extending the Use of Automated Text Analysis in Political Science and Political Psychology."*  

This project replicates key analyses from the original study, specifically:  
- **Replication of Figure 1 and Figure 2**, focusing on the impact of text sources and preprocessing on linguistic analysis.  
- **Extension: Sentiment analysis**, exploring how emotional tone affects the interpretation of political speeches.

## Replication Summary
### **Figure 1 and Figure 2 Replication**
- The original study examines how political scientists and political psychologists apply different text analysis methods.  
- Figure 1 and Figure 2 visualize the linguistic patterns in speeches by political candidates, emphasizing the importance of text source selection and preprocessing choices.

### **Sentiment Analysis Extension**
- To extend the analysis, sentiment scores were calculated using the **Syuzhet method**, which identifies the emotional tone of speeches.  
- The extension examines whether **unsupervised text models, like Wordfish, inadvertently capture sentiment alongside policy positions**.  
- Findings suggest that sentiment influences text-based policy position estimates, highlighting the need for careful methodological considerations.

## Key Findings
- Successfully replicated Figure 1 and Figure 2 from the original study.  
- Demonstrated that **preprocessing decisions significantly impact text analysis results**.  
- Sentiment analysis shows that **emotional tone can distort ideological measurements in automated text models**.  
- Findings support the integration of **sentiment analysis into text-based political research** for more accurate interpretations.
